        <p>Bicol Express is a creamy stew that combines spice and sweetness in a well-balanced manner. The dish makes use of ginger and local seasonings resulting in a flavorful combination of meat and sauce.</p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tbsp cooking oil, as needed</li>
          <li>1 pc onion chopped</li>
          <li>8 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
          <li>2 tbsp shrimp paste (not sweet)</li>
          <li>1/2 kg pork, cut into thin strips</li>
          <li>1 (40 g) pack Knorr Ginataang Gulay Mix dissolved in 1-1/2 cups water</li>
          <li>6 pcs green chillies, sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, get it nice and hot on medium-high heat. When hot enough, pour in a little oil and throw in the onions, garlic, ginger and shrimp paste.</li>
            
            <li>Mash the shrimp paste and sauté the vegetables until you can smell the lovely aroma from the combined ingredients.</li>
            
            <li>It&apos;s time to add the pork. Allow the pork to cook for just a minute together with the aromatics (onions, garlic and ginger) to remove the gamey taste of the meat.</li>

            <li>You may now pour the dissolved Knorr Complete Recipe Mix Ginataang Gulay and bring this to a boil. Adjust your heat to low and cook this to simmer before adding the chilies. Stir once in a while then finish by cooking the pork until tender.</li>
            
            <li>Serve this dish hot but make sure you have enough rice for your family because they will definitely crave for more.</li>
        </ol>
